<p>Now with full support for <b>.NET 4.0, 4.5 and Mono</b> and with a ton of news
and enhancements. </p>
<p>After some time off for different reasons we are now trying to
update the library in a more regular fashion. We redesigned the HomeSite with a <a target="_blank" href="http://themeforest.net/item/materialize-material-design-admin-template/11446068">Material Design Template from GeeksLabs</a></p>

<h4>Main changes</h4>

<ul>

    <h3>2.0</h3>


    The library has passed its 1st birthday !!! and thanks to the work
    and contribution of a lot of people ([partial list of
    them)](credits.html)

    Too many things were changed, mostly internally, now we have a
    performance gain of more than 60% in .NET 2.0

    I will be releasing the version for .NET 1.1 because I know that a
    lot of people use it in some corporations, but maybe in the next
    releases the new features will be .net 2.0 only. It's a massive job
    maintain and optimize both =( versions

    There are also a lot of major changes, refactoring in the code, and
    a big core rewrite that allow the engines to use less memory and
    temporary string (we are using more buffers to avoid this)

    We were very busy to keep to library updated and to give support to
    the users. Check the forums for any problems as it's likely they
    have been addressed here.

    We have our own domain www.filehelpers.com thanks to (Antoine) and a
    DevBlog at http://blog.filehelpers.com

    Here do you have all the stuff that keep me busy for a while :P

    <h4>   Breaking Changes</h4>
    <ul>

        <li>The constructor of the MultiRecordEngine was changed to
            allow params args, and to allow users to not pass the
            RecordSelector (in write operations where it was not
            needed).
        </li>
        <li>EndsRead and EndsWrite deleted, now you have a Close()
            operation to simplify the API and to make it similar to the
            System.Data namespace. (The async engines also implement
            IDisposable)
        </li>
        <li>Rename FileHelperException --\> FileHelpers Exception a
            better name =) and an easy to solve problem
        </li>
        <li>By default the numeric fields in the FixedLengthRecords that
            don't have an [FieldAlign] will be aligned to the right and
            the rest the left by default, with this we avoid the problem
            of generate files with different meaning when reading and
            writing
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>   Performance related</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>Internal use of Reflection.Emit, Dynamic Methods and char
            buffers to get **more than 50% enhancement in performance
            and for .NET 2.0 more than 65%**
        </li>
        <li>The Read..AsDT methods now creates the DataTable record by
            record, not at the end, so you can handle large files
            without any memory overload
        </li>
        <li>No more reflection in the operations (only in the
            constructors).
        </li>
        <li>FieldSorter faster too, Removed REFLECTION for EMIT
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>   Shining new features</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The very cool
            [DelimitedFileEngine](example_delimitedengine.html) and
            [FixedFileEngine](example_fixedengine.html) that allow to
            change options at RunTime (also with generic versions)
            [Check an example here](example_generics.html)
        </li>
        <li>[ConditionalRecords](example_conditionalrecords.html) you
            can easily include or exclude certain records based on a
            RecordCondition (like BeginsWith, EndsWith, Contains or
            RegEx) [Check the example](example_conditionalrecords.html)
        </li>
        <li>A new GenericDatabaseStorage to allow databases use ADO.NET
            to work with the FileHelpers (Thanks Rodolfo Finochietti)
        </li>
        <li>Experimental [Mono project](http://www.mono-project.com)
            Support (some users are already using it, we hope that in
            the next release we have a completely working version for
            this framework)
        </li>
        <li>New version checker in the demos and wizard (both with a
            renewed look and feel) [Check the
            movies](http://www.filehelpers.com/movies.html)
        </li>
        <li>.NET 2.0 Nullable Types support. (Thanks Vijayan) [Check the
            example](example_nullable.html)
        </li>
        <li>Notification Interfaces: you can now get notified of the
            events simply implement them
        </li>
        <li>Enhanced Debugging in .NET 2.0 with DebuggerDisplay and
            DebuggerBrowsable, DebugVisualizars to come.
        </li>
        <li>The wizard has a record class test that allows you to
            introduce sample data and your class and check for errors or
            results.
        </li>
        <li>You can [check our
            screencasts](http://www.filehelpers.com/movies.html) for the
            demos, wizard and other features of the library.
        </li>
        <li>Now the code for Vs2003 and Vs2005 are both on SVN, sharing
            the same files and the build script autodetect your Visual
            Studio installation. So no more excuses time to get involved
            =)
        </li>
        <li>The engines with asynchronous operations are now IDisposable
            and IEnumerable so you can declare it with using(..) and use
            them in a foreach loop
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h4>   API changes and extensions</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>The write methods are less strict. You can pass now an
            IEnumerable instead of an array, so you can directly pass a
            List or ArrayList to the method without doing a ToArray()
        </li>
        <li>RunTime records can now get a DataTable in the constructor
            and use DataColumns to create one field for each column.
        </li>
        <li>Generic versions of near all the engines of the library (it
            is really hard to maintain the two copies :P so everyone it
            is time to port !!)
        </li>
        <li>Asynchronous operations in others engines like the
            MultiRecordEngine
        </li>
        <li>Event support to the MultiRecordEngine thanks to the
            contribution of Francis de Fouchier
        </li>
        <li>The library now handles infinite levels of inheritance
            adding the high level fields first in the result record
            class.
        </li>
        <li>Allow to ignore spaces and tabs in the
            [IgnoreEmptyLinesAttribute](FileHelpers.IgnoreEmptyLinesAttribute.html)
        </li>
        <li>[IgnoreCommentedLines](FileHelpers.IgnoreCommentedLinesAttribute.html)
            thanks to MCampbell
        </li>
        <li>The Read methods now have a maxRecords args to tell to the
            engines how much them must read.
        </li>
        <li>A new constructor overload to the engine that allow to pass
            the Encoding. This is useful to make the users aware of the
            Encoding feature.
        </li>
        <li>FileTransformEngine with two new methods
            ReadAndTransformRecords and TransformRecords
        </li>
        <li>Flush method to AsyncEngines to allow users to ensure data
            is written. For example, if they are using the library for
            logging.
        </li>
        <li>The converters are now smarter as they validate to which
            types can be assigned and throw exceptions if converter is
            wrong (for example if you use ConverterKind.Decimal in a int
            field)
        </li>
        <li>The [ConvertException](FileHelpers.ConvertException.html)
            has a lot of context information: LineNumber, ColumnNumber,
            FieldName. Also better exception messages.
        </li>
        <li>The integer converters receive now take a decimal separator
            to build an InvariantCulture to format and parse the values
            and strings
        </li>
    </ul>


    <h4>   Small changes</h4>

    <ul>

        <li>Fixed the problem with ASP.NET: "Line 0: Metadata file
            'filehelpers.dll' could not be found"
        </li>
        <li>Fixed some problems with the CsvClassBuilder (it is a good
            practice to not to release the last minute added features)
        </li>
        <li>The assemblies are now signed
        </li>
        <li>The new ConverterBase.DefaultDateTimeFormat to avoid set the
            converter format field by field =)
        </li>
        <li>Some error messages from the library were rewritten and now
            provides more contextual information (line and column
            numbers, field name, etc).
        </li>
        <li>ExcelStorage supports more than 26 columns (thanks to Mark
            Izendooren)
        </li>
        <li>Encoding support to the CsvEngine
        </li>
        <li>The wizard remembers all the paths now
        </li>
        <li>SkipThisRecord in the AfterReadRecordEventArgs, this allows
            engine to skip records from the results (thanks Crestline)
        </li>
        <li>More methods for the
            [CommonEngine](FileHelpers.CommonEngineMembers.html)
        </li>
        <li>More than [420+ NUnit tests](testing.html) !!! (I cant
            believe it, I'm a lazy developer but I know how much value
            you get out of testing the library)
        </li>
        <li>You now have two versions for the demos, one for each
            framework version.
        </li>

-   [1.6.0 (Aug-2006)]

    The library has 10 months now and a lot of things were added. So I
    want to thank all the people who send their feedback, posted
    motivating entries on the web and a lot of other ones that help me
    in the development. ([partial list of contributors)](credits.html)

    Now the important things !!... [**RunTime
    Records**](runtime_classes.html) are here thanks to some help
    Gerhardt Scriven to use RunTime Compilation. Enjoy it !!

    **I think in this version as 2.0** because the RunTime Records
    functionalities were one of the most requested features and also one
    of the hardest to implement features. A lot of effort was put into
    usability and a clear API, if you have any suggestion please post it
    in the forums =)
     Other important news are the
    [CsvEngine](FileHelpers.CsvEngine.html) (for generic CSV files), the
    [FileDiffEngine](example_filediffengine.html), the
    [MultiRecordEngine](example_multirecords.html),..

    **Breaking changes:**

    -   MOD: **Now the FixedLengthRecords must contain the exact number
        of characters**. You can pass an extra parameter in the
        [FixedLengthRecord] attribute to allow a different behavior.
    -   MOD: CommonActions renamed to CommonSelector in the
        MasterDetailEngine

    **Major changes:**

    -   ADD: The awaited RunTime Records thanks to the suggestion of
        Gerhardt Scriven to use RunTime Compilation. Supports for
        classes written in C\# and VB.NET
         There are a lot of features inside this new feature, [so take a
        look at the docs](runtime_classes.html)
    -   MOD: The **Record wizard** was completely rewritten to use the
        run time records and now has a lot of options to check the
        classes that you are building, in the future the wizard could
        help you discovering the record class based on a sample file
    -   ADD: Generic CSV files are now supported (for example Excel
        generated ones)
         Was a hard work but worth it because it can be used with any
        engine.
         In the next version I'll add the Excellent [Fast CSV
        Reader](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/database/CsvReader.aspx)
        from **S?stien Lorion** for standalone CSV processing.
    -   ADD: [Event support](events.html) !! From this version the
        FileHelperEngine has 4 events, 2 for read operations and 2 for
        write that are thrown before and after process each record.
    -   ADD: FileDiffEngine to compare files with the same record
        layout.
    -   ADD: MultiRecordEngine to read files with different record
        layouts.
    -   ADD: DataTableToCsv, CsvToDataTable, RecordsToDataTable,
        RemoveDuplicateRecords and other methods to the CommonEngine
    -   ADD: FixedMode Enum for fixed length records, used to provide
        better validation in fixed length files
    -   ADD: Template support in ExcelStorage
    -   ADD: [A lot of new examples check it out !!](examples.html)
    -   MOD: The decimal, double, and single converters now receive an
        string param to set the decimal delimiter (by default is ".")
    -   MOD: Improved documentation in the SDK, the general help and
        examples. (Thanks Antoine)

    **Minor changes:**

    -   FIX: FieldDelimiter doesn't work very well after the refactoring
        of the previous version.
    -   FIX: Bug when copy or saving to file in the wizard
    -   DEL: more and more properties of the internal classes, this
        enhances both the performance and the dll size.
    -   MOD: A lot of internal refactoring and enhancements
    -   MOD: ExcelStorage now returns the cells values when using
        ErrorMode.SaveAndContinue
    -   ADD: [These excellent **VB.NET - C\# comparison cheat
        sheets**](http://blog.krisvandermast.com/VBNETCComparisonCheatSheets.aspx)
        (to avoid translating the examples)
    -   ADD: RecordsToDataTable in the CommonEngine
    -   ADD: A lot of options to CommonSelector like: MasterIfBegins,
        MasterIfEnds, MasterIfEnclosed and the details counterparts
    -   ADD: BooleanConverter can receive two arguments for the true or
        false values
    -   ADD: New constructor to the SqlServerStorage to directly pass
        the ConnectionString. Thanks to Anatoly Kleyman
    -   ADD: Again a lot of new [NUnit tests](testing.html) near the 320
        (wow I never thought of writing that many)
    -   ADD: [Library statistics](statistics.html) page.
    -   ADD: [**How to help me with the development of the
        Library**](howhelp.html) page.


-   [1.5.0 (Jun-2006)]

    There have been some delays but the library is always moving forward
    thanks to hard work and the help from all of you.

    **Breaking changes:**

    -   Both DataStorage types: SqlServerStorage and AccessStorage
        completely changed, from now you don't need to override this
        classes (in fact you can't because they are sealed)
         You can use these classes as client and provide the callbacks
        for the Insert and Fill record methods.([check the
        examples](examples.html))
    -   The FieldQuoted attribute was completely rewritten to support
        optional quote for read, write or both.
         So you need to use now the QuoteMode enum and not only a
        boolean. (For Excel generated CSV files you must use the
        QuoteMode.OptionalForBoth value) ([check the
        examples](examples.html))
    -   MOD: DataBaseStorage to DatabaseStorage (Case change)
    -   MOD: Extract and Insert Records now returns the inserted or
        extracted records

    **Major changes:**

    -   ADD: New **FieldOptional** that allows that the n last fields of
        a record be optional.
    -   ADD: Multiline Quoted Field support (with this we finish the
        support for Excel generated CSV files)
    -   ADD: Multiline Records supports via the FieldInNewLine attribute
        to allow records to span multiple lines
    -   ADD: OleDbStorage thanks to Permjeet Pandha to use with any Data
        Storage that supports OleDb access.
    -   ADD: The ReadMethods of the FileHelperEngine can return the data
        as a **DataTable** the suffix of this methods are **AsDT**. That
        is perfect to load sample data into your NUnit test (examples
        coming soon)
    -   ADD: New **IgnoreEmptyLines** that allows you to mark a record
        with it to ignore empty lines in the source data.
    -   ADD: CommonEngine.**SortFile**and**SortRecords**by field or
        using the IComparable interface if the records implement it.
    -   ADD: New demo code in a Console Application project to make easy
        to newbies play with the library. ([download it from the
        examples](examples.html))
    -   MOD: A lot of refactoring in the source code and changes in the
        folder layout.
    -   MOD: Code in the Docs now highlighted with the excellent
        [dp.SyntaxHighlighter](http://www.dreamprojections.com/syntaxhighlighter/?ref=filehelpers)
        from Alex Gorbatchev

    **Minor changes:**

    -   FIX: The AsyncEngine could close the File in the BeginWriteFile
        under some conditions.
    -   FIX: IO Exception when appending to an empty file.
    -   FIX: Syntax in some samples and in the Wizard Templates.
    -   FIX: The notify progress in the DatabaseStorage working fine and
        tested.
    -   FIX: A little issue in the DatabaseStorage that can throws
        InvalidaCastException in the constructor.
    -   DEL: A lot of properties in the internal classes were deleted
        (aiming to reduce the dll size and library performance, much
        better for Compact Framework)
    -   DEL: The obsolete LastErrors of the ErrorManager. Now it is
        mandatory to use Errors.
    -   ADD: More and enhanced [NUnit tests](testing.html) (more than
        260) based in the coverage of clover.net
    -   ADD: Some new and corrected [Usage examples](examples.html)
    -   ADD: Now the wizard supports FieldOptional and IgnoreEmptyLines,
        also you can generate the properties that map to the fields
        (useful for Data Binding the RecordClass to any binding aware
        control in VS2005)
    -   ADD: Encoding support for source and destination in the
        transformation engine.
    -   ADD: A new feature for the custom converters to allow them to
        handle the null values
    -   ADD: More features in the CommonEngine: TransformFile and the
        fast TransformFileAsync
    -   ADD: two easy methods to export/import data to/from a file.
    -   MOD: Wizard: now use the Beta2 of the excellent [FireBall
        CodeEditor](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/fireballcodeeditor.aspx).
    -   MOD: A lot of documentation corrections and additions
    -   MOD: Demo application rewritten to show some new features and
        show the syntax changes in the old ones.


-   [1.4.0 (17-Mar-2006)]
    -   Major changes:
        <li>DEL: ConverterKind.Custom was removed because it was
            irrelevant to use custom converters now the library uses
            [FieldConverter(typeof(YouConverter))]
        <li>DEL: Some Exceptions trying to simplify the Exception
            handling and reducing the number of different exceptions.
            The deleted exceptions are **NullValueException,
            QuotedStringException and InternalException all replaced
            with the BadUsageException**.
        <li>FIX: The Async engines now uses the ErrorMode in all cases.
        <li>MOD: The MasterDetailEngine now takes the IgnoreFirst and
            IgnoreLast options from the master record an not from the
            detail.
        <li>MOD: All methods in the FileHelpers Engines that **returned
            bool changed to void** because they was using error handling
            with exceptions and a bool result is redundant and useless,
            this provides a clearer OO design.
        <li>MOD: [LoadErrors](example_errorhandling.html) from the
            ErrorManager class now is static.
        <li>ADD: [The CommonEngine](example_commonengine.html): with
            four static methods for the common operations.
        <li>ADD: [The progress notification
            feature](example_progress.html), with it you can get
            notified of the progress of each operation.
        <li>ADD: Full ExcelCSV support, a new parameter to the
            FieldQuoted attribute to indicate if the Quote is optional
            (like excel does with CSV)
        <li>NEWS: Full Subversion support in Sourceforge: now you can
            help in the development using any subversion client and send
            me the patches with your changes.
            [https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/filehelpers/trunk](https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/filehelpers/trunk)
        <li>NEWS: [FileHelpers
            Forums](http://www.filehelpers.com/forums/) the main please
            for your feedback and discussions about the
            library.[](https://svn.sourceforge.net/svnroot/filehelpers/trunk)

    -   Minor changes:
        <li>DEL: Description property to the FieldBase this is really
            old (from the beginning of the library.)
        <li>DEL: Demo zip file now is merged into the binary zip.
        <li>MOD: EngineBase.LineNum and ErrorInfo.LineNum now are
            **LineNumber**.
        <li>MOD: Enhanced exception messages.
        <li>MOD: SaveErrors can receive a header string to write into
            the file.
        <li>MOD: ErrorManager.**LastErrors renamed
            to**ErrorManager.**Errors**
        <li>ADD: The ExcelStorage checks if Excel is installed, if not
            throws a BadUsageException
        <li>ADD: More [NUnit tests](testing.html) (more than 185)
        <li>ADD: A lot of new [Usage Examples](examples.html).
        <li>ADD: A new form in the demo app that shows how to use the
            [ProgressNotification](example_progress.html).
        <li>ADD: Wizard: now use the [FireBall
            CodeEditor](http://www.codeproject.com/KB/miscctrl/fireballcodeeditor.aspx)
            for syntax highlighting.
        <li>ADD: Wizard: a lot of new templates and fixes in others.
